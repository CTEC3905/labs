## 08-lab: CSS animation and transition

### Introduction

This week’s lab follows on from the lecture material covering animations. The [example repository](https://github.com/CTEC3905/08-lab) has a CSS keyframes animation example, and a branch with an image caption transition that fades up on hover.

### Task 1 - run the code and inspect it

The master branch ???

Navigate to the folder where you store your CTEC3905 work, then `git clone https://github.com/CTEC3905/08-lab` and `cd 08-lab`.

Create a new repository on your own GitHub account and copy its remote URL (from the green "Clone or Download" button), then back in the command-line, change the remote to your new repo with `git remote set-url origin YOUR_NEW_REPO`, then check it with `git remote -v`.

You can then experiment with the code, make changes, and push your version to your own account.

### Task 2 - create your own animation

Create a simple animation of your own, using the advised properties (see the readme) and run it. You can make slideshows and other features using just CSS animations—next week some further examples will be made available.

### Task 3 - Checkout the other branch

**NOTE:** **quit Atom** before checking out a branch!

Make sure you have added and committed any changes you've made to your master branch.

See the list of available branches using:  
`git branch -a`

Checkout the other branch using:  
`git checkout css-transition`

Note how the files in your local repository have changed. Inspect the new code and run it in the browser, and read the readme file for this branch.

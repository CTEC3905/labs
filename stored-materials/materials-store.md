##Task 1 - CSS grid layout

CSS Grid is complex and fairly new, but it provides the layout tools that front-end developers have wanted for some time.

You can reposition any element in the grid wherever you like, using a breakpoint.

1. Either clone or download the code from [GitHub 06-lab-cssgrid](https://GitHub.com/ctec3905/06-lab-cssgrid/) and run it in a browser. Change the window width to see the mobile and larger versions of the layout.
2. Add some text and image content inside the grid elements, and a 4-item menu in the `nav` tag, using flexbox (flexbox can be used to order elements *inside* a grid container) and resize the window in and out to test your new page.
3. Add another breakpoint above the 600px one, to rearrange the grid content areas for larger screen sizes. This doesn’t need to make design or logical sense - it’s just an experiment.
4. If you already started your site and have content, work out how you could arrange the main content areas using CSS grid.

You should have a responsive grid-based layout that works at mobile sizes, then at tablet, then at desktop widths (mobile styles plus two breakpoints).
